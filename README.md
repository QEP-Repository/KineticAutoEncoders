# KineticAutoEncoders
Autoencoders developed for kinetic profiles (electron density and temperature) in nuclear fusion.  

The work has been presented at EPS - 51st EPS Conference on Plasma Physics, 7 â€“ 11 July 2025, Vilnius, Lithuania - https://epsplasma2025.com/

The poster presented results obtained with JET (Joint European Torus) data, which cannot be publicly shared. 

However, the repository has been developed with synthetic profiles and therefore you can just download the codes and run "Main_KineticAutoEncoder.m".
